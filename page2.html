                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-7">The project presents a systematic study directed toward understanding of the fundamental aspects for two-dimensional van der Waals materials for optical information transfer and processing. The project is devoted to developing i) fundamental insights into the kinet- ics of strongly correlated electronic system and its interactions with photons in mono- and multilayer emergent two-dimensional materials; ii) collective quantum phenomena includ- ing Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity of excitons and cavity polaritons in these materials; iii) analysis of possibilities to control nonlinear optical properties of exciton sys- tems in multilayers by applied gate voltage; iv) developing applications of polariton systems for spintronics using spin Hall effect for excitons; and v) polariton guiding in doped and multi-layered two-dimensional structures with the goal to harness the light-matter interac- tions for the development of new physical principles for the design of room-temperature nanophotonic devices for optoelectronics. We will study electronic and optical properties of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC), where the transition metal atoms of molybde- num or tungsten are positioned between the layers of chalcogens, such as sulfur, selenium or tellurium. Our team will focus on the properties of quasiparticles such as direct, dipolar, and charge transfer excitons in TMDC double layers and multilayers and polaritons, formed by microcavity photons and excitons in a TMDC layer, embedded in a semiconductor mi- crocavity.<br>The research will addressed the following topics: Light-matter interactions and collec- tive quantum dynamics by considering the quantum kinetics of coupled charges and photons and the interaction with phonons, to understand the charge and photon transport in TMDC- based structures. Low-energy consumption room-temperature optoelectronic devices by con- sidering the coupled charge and photon dynamics in multilayered structures, to reveal the conditions under which the photon guiding and controlled propagation can be achieved with the focus on the foundation of new-generation optoelectronics. We will obtain the polariton flow induced by the spin flow due to spin Hall effect for excitons in TMDC. We propose to study the effects of a periodic potential on a superfluid of polaritons, formed by excitons in a TMDC monolayer. Optimizing room-temperature polaritonic circuit performance. The obtained knowledge of TMDC mono- and double-layer systems, and their interactions with light will be harnessed to find the conditions and geometries for optimal performance of active optoelectronic and spintronic systems.<br><br><br><strong>1. Light-matter interactions and collective quantum dynamics.</strong> By considering the quantum kinetics of coupled charges and photons and the interaction with phonons, to understand the charge and photon transport in TMDC-based structures. By grasping the details of the degenerate electron gas - photon interactions, to elucidate the quantum collective dynamics including a Bose- Einstein condensation and superfluidity for dipolar excitons in TMDC double layers, and cavity polaritons, formed by excitons in a TMDC monolayer embedded in a semiconductor microcavity, and microcavity photons in a wide range of temperatures.<br><br><strong>2. Search for room-temperature (room-T) Bose-Einstein condensation.</strong> By varying the external pumping rate P, temperature T, the energy difference between the excitonic and photonic ground states (i.e., the detuning δ), and the coverage percentage of the cavity by TMDC flakes, σ, we will determine the conditions where the phase coherence and a macroscopic occupation of the ground state occurs, which are signatures of the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the system [42, 43]. We will construct a phase map that pinpoints the range of parameters (P, T, δ, σ) where the polariton gas undergoes the nonequilibrium BEC transition. From the results of conventional experiments with semiconductor quantum wells [44]. it is known that the most favorable conditions for a BEC occur where the polaritons are more light-like (δ &lt; 0). Thus, in our studies, we, first, explore the range of negative detunings. However, zero detunings will also be studied since these states are important for our planned experiments on optical and electric control of the polariton flows.<br>We begin our studies with MoS2 and then, will expand our approach to other TMDC materials MX2. The results of the simulations will be compared with the obtained experi- mental data and important parameters of the system (such as the effective polariton lifetime and the polariton-polariton interaction strength) will be determined.<br><br><strong>3. Optical control of the polariton flows.</strong> We will explore the effects of the inho- mogeneity in the optical pumping and its use for the optical control of the polariton flows via optical nonlinearity in the system. We, first, study the polaritons dynamics in the case where a macroscopic polariton flux is generated in the system. Such a flux can be achieved, for example, by setting a non-zero opening angle between the diffraction Bragg reflectors (DBR) (i.e., by accelerating the polaritons in the “wedge” geometry of the cavity) [45, 46] or by creating a non-equilibrium population of polaritons with a finite in-plane momentum by the resonance optical pumping in a cavity with parallel DBR. We, then, will determine the variations in the polariton flow in the case where the second, controlling light spot will be applied in the area where the polaritons are spreading.<br>3.A. Study of the effectiveness of quasiparticle scattering vs. the blue shift for room-T optical control. We expect two general mechanisms that could lead to the changes in the polariton flows by the application of an additional laser spot: (i) scattering of the quasiparticles on the cloud of polaritons created by the additional (controlling) pump; and (ii) the blue shift in the quasiparticle energies in presence of the increased quasiparticle density at the controlling laser spot. We will explore the relative contribution of the two factors on the polariton flow changes around the spot by varying the incoming flux value and the pump rate for the controlling spot. Understanding of the leading mechanism of the optical control of the polariton flux will provide us with important information for the design of optically-controlled polariton circuits as detailed below. The optical control is shown to be a solid strategy for the design of optoelectronic devices at cryogenic temperatures [47–49]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the respective approaches have never been tested at room temperatures. Due to enhanced exciton and polariton stability, the TMDC structures provide unprecedented opportunity for the optical control in the room-temperature optical systems and will potentially lead to the design of optoelectronic devices. We will start our consideration with a cavity with embedded MoS2 monolayer and then, will explore other MX2 materials.<br><br><strong>4. Electron-polariton drag in a single-layer system, and the electric polariton guiding</strong>. The mutual scattering of charges and polaritons will be explored as a mechanism that enables one to drive polaritons by an electric current in the TMDC layer. In this case, we consider overlapping TMDC flakes that constitute an electrically continuous system. (It is, however, optically discontinuous since the double-layer in the overlapping regions is optically inactive. We will capture it by setting ΩR = 0 in the double layer regions.) Physically, the proposed mechanism of the polariton drag lies in the entrainment of the exciton component of the polariton in the motion (due to mutual scattering with the momentum exchange) by an in-plane electric current in TMDC layer created by an external voltage applied to the layer. It is worth noting that the drag in multi-layered systems where the excitons and electrons lie in different quantum well and, thus, are spatially separated was considered earlier in Refs. 40, 41. However, to the best of our knowledge, the polariton drag in the system where the excitons and electrons are located in the same TMDC layer has never been considered.<br>4.A. Room-T polariton control by the external electric field. This new arrange- ment will provide an extended opportunity for the control of the polariton flows by the external electric fields. In our studied, the linear response of the polariton flux of the exter- nal electric field will be calculated analytically, via the linearized coupled kinetic equation for the moving charges and the polaritons (with the assumption that the system is weakly non-equilibrium), and numerically, by considering the full system of equations described above. Then, the results of the two approaches will be compared and the conclusion about the validity of the linearized theory will be made. Conditions will be determined, under which a steady non-zero polariton flux is formed in the presence of a uniform electric field in the microcavity plane. The effective propagation length of polaritons along the electric current (in the direction of the current for positively-doped systems and in the opposite direction, if the system is negatively doped) will be determined numerically, as a function of the controlling parameters (temperature, detuning, the electric field strength, and coverage). The optimal range of parameters will be determined for the creation of the polariton flows along the cavity in the presence of the driving electric field. This information will provide a base for the numerical design of an electrically-controlled polariton circuits as is detailed below.<br><br><strong>5. Low-energy consumption room-temperature optoelectronic devices.</strong> By considering the coupled charge and photon dynamics in multilayered structures, to reveal the conditions under which the photon guiding and controlled propagation can be achieved with the focus on the foundation of new-generation optoelectronics. By using dissipationless (superfluid) quantum exciton and polariton states, to find the conditions for low-energy con- sumption coherent large-distance signal transmission and routing. By considering patterned microcavities to design optically and electrically controlled polaritonic routers, detectors and emitters. The drag effects in the system of spatially separated electrons and excitons in dou- ble layers, embedded in an optical microcavity can cause the flows of polaritons [50, 51]. Due to exciton-electron interaction, at low temperature an electron current induces the po- lariton flow, therefore, a transport of photons along the cavity [51]. We will study how drag effects can be applied to design novel optical devices.<br><br><strong>6. Polariton dynamics in optical circuits.</strong> The next logical step is the consideration of the polariton controlled propagation in quasi-one dimensional structures, or channels. The polariton wire provides an apt metaphor for such a channel [41]. To form the channels, a few experimental approaches has been earlier considered, including a) deposition of a metal pattern on the Bragg reflectors [52]; b) shaping of the underlying substrate layer [53]; and c) micropillar channels in air-filled and buffer-material-filled cavities [54, 55]. Our over- all goal is to utilize the polariton-structure interactions and the optical or electric control to steer the polaritons and to “bring” them to a desired location. Following our previous consideration [41], we will model the wire as a channel-shaped potential V (r) acting on the polaritons. First, will be determined the optimal parameters of the energy landscape that provides the functionality allowing the polaritons to effectively propagate along the wire and be localized in the direction perpendicular to the wire. The effect of temperature on the localization of the polariton flow within a channel will be studied.<br>6.A. Search for the optimal strategy for polariton driving and switching in optical systems. Then, we will compare the utility of (a) the wedged microcavity, (b) the resonance driving by the optical pump, and (c) the electric drag for the acceleration of the polaritons in the potential landscape and, by this means, for the generation in a controllable way of a directed polariton flux along the wire. Further, we will study the effect of the optical and electric control on the polariton flux. For the optical control, the two mechanisms will be considered including the scattering on an exciton cloud created by a controlling laser spot and the polariton-exciton repulsion due to the blue shift in the region of the controlling spot, as explained in this Section above. For the electric control in a doped microcavity, the external electric field will be utilized to push the polaritons in the desired direction or stop them. Finally, we will consider more topologically complex channels such as Y-shaped channels [41] to provide the effective means for the design of the optically and electrically controlled polariton systems. In the optically controlled switch, for example, the case will be studies where the polariton flow propagating along the stem of the Y-shaped channel will be blocked by a controlling laser spot in one branch and hence, will propagate along another branch. By setting the temperature to the room temperature, we will explore the performance of the proposed setups as a function of the system parameters (detuning, the channel depth, doping, coverage) for the MX2 TMDC materials.<br><br><strong>7. Optimizing room-temperature polaritonic circuit performance. </strong>The ob- tained knowledge of TMDC mono- and double-layer systems, and their interactions with light (including nonlinear excitons and polaritons interactions in a single- and multilayered structures) will be harnessed to find the conditions and geometries for optimal performance of active optoelectronic systems. By considering optical circuits, interconnecting several optoelectronic elements and devices, to optimize the over-all performance of the circuits. The distributed systems for solar energy harvesting will be theoretically considered and optimized for the conditions where the solar energy absorbing sites and optical-to-electric energy conversion site are spatially separated and coupled via the exchange of polaritonic quasiparticles.<br><br><strong>8. Spin Hall Effect (SHE) for polaritons (and dipolaritons) formed by excitons in a TMDC monolayer (double layer), embedded in a semiconductor microcavity.</strong> Our study will focus on the spin Hall effect (SHE) for polaritons (or dipolaritons) in a semiconductor microcavity with embedded TMDC monolayer (double layer). Aforemen- tioned polaritons and dipolaritons are formed in a microcavity with embedded TMDC mono- layer or double layer, respectively. The flow of polaritons (or dipolaritons) can be induced by creation the gradient of exciton concentration by nonhomogeneous laser pumping. Due to strong spin orbit coupling (SOC) in a TMDC double layer, SHE generates the transverse spin current, associated with excitons, in a TMDC double layer as a response to a longi- tudinal gradient of exciton concentration. A light-induced SHE for excitons in a TMDC double bilayer was proposed [56]. When two infrared, spatially varying laser beams are cou- pled to the excitons, since the exciton spin dynamics is much faster than its center-of-mass, the Born-Oppenheimer approximation results in a spin-dependent gauge field, acting on the center-of-mass motion of an exciton [57]. An effective Hamiltonian of the center-of-mass motion of an exciton in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation has the form [56]:<br>Hσ= 1 (P−Aσ)2+Vσ, (7) 2M associated with different spin states of a conduction band electron, forming an exciton, σ =↑ and ↓, where P is the momentum of the center-of-mass of the exciton, M is the exciton total mass, Vσ and Aσ are the spin-dependent gauge scalar and vector potential, correspondingly, which depend the coordinate R = (X, Y ) of the center-of-mass of the exciton. The effective gauge magnetic field Bσ is defined as Bσ = ∇R × Aσ .<br>The gauge field leads to spin-dependent deflection of the motion of the exciton center-of- mass, and, therefore, exciton spin Hall effect: a pure exciton spin current flowing transverse to the gauge field. Since the gauge field depends on the spin of an electron in a conduction band, forming the exciton, for the laser pumping frequencies, corresponding to the resonant excitations of one type (A or B) of excitons, the corresponding excitons together with coupled to them photons will deflect to only one transverse direction, while for the laser pumping frequencies, corresponding to another type (A or B) of excitons, the corresponding excitons will deflect to the opposite transverse direction. Therefore, the SHE for one type (A or B) excitons in a TMDC double layer lead not only to the transverse spin current, but also the mass and energy flows in the corresponding transverse direction.<br>8.A. SHE for polaritons, formed by excitons in a TMDC monolayer, embedded in a microcavity and cavity photons. (1) SHE for polaritons in the presence of the gradient of exciton concentration. We will consider polaritons formed by excitons in a TMDC monolayer, embedded in a microcavity and microcavity photons. We will obtain the flow of polaritons as a linear response with respect to the gradient of exciton concentration. This flow of polaritons will have the transverse component due to the SHE, induced by two infrared, spatially varying laser beams, resulting in an effective gauge magnetic field. The procedure for calculation of this polariton flow is described in Sec. II.<br>(2) SHE and drag effect for polaritons in the presence of an electron current in a parallel TMDC monolayer. Another method to initiate the polariton flow is to use the drag effect, when another doped TMDC monolayer is placed parallel to the TMDC monolayer with excitons and separated from TMDC layers with excitons by hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) insulating layers. The electron current, caused by the gate voltage applied to the doped TMDC monolayer, will initiate caused by the SHE transverse polariton flow in the microcavity via the drag effect, occurred due to the exciton-electron interaction [51]. The drag coefficients, related to this transverse polariton flow, will be calculated based on Boltzmann kinetic equations for the polariton distribution function, similarly to the procedure, described in Ref. 37.<br>8.B. SHE for dipolaritons, formed by direct and indirect excitons in a TMDC double layer, embedded in a microcavity and cavity photons. (1) SHE for dipolaritons in the presence of the gradient of exciton concentration. We will consider dipolaritons formed by microcavity photons and direct and indirect excitons in a TMDC double layer, embedded in a microcavity. We will calculate the flow or dipolaritons as a linear response with respect to the gradient of indirect exciton concentration. This flow of dipolaritons will have the transverse component caused by the SHE. The approach for calculation of this polariton flow is described in Sec. II. (2) SHE and drag effect for dipolaritons in the presence of an electron current in a parallel TMDC monolayer. We will consider also the method to initiate the dipolariton flow by using the drag effect, when another doped TMDC monolayer is placed parallel to the TMDC double layer with direct and indirect excitons and separated from TMDC layers with excitons by h-BN insulating layers. The electron current, caused by the gate voltage applied to the doped TMDC monolayer, will initiate caused by SHE transverse dipolariton flow in the microcavity via the drag effect. The drag coefficients for this transverse dipolariton flow will be obtained applying Boltzmann kinetic equations for the dipolariton distribution function, following to the approach given in Ref. 37. The importance of SHE for polaritons and dipolaritons. In TMDC monolayers (or double layers) the flow of polaritons (or dipolaritons), associated with the mentioned above exciton spin current, results in the flow of photons, coupled to direct excitons in a TMDC monolayer or direct and dipolar excitons in a TMDC double layers. Therefore, we propose the method to control photon flows by the gradient of exciton concentration, created by nonhomogeneous laser pumping, or by the gate voltage applied to the doped TMDC monolayer, placed parallel to a TMDC double layer. For the tasks A(2) and B we will study the dependence of the SHE on the number of h-BN insulating layers between the electron current-carrying TMDC layer and the exciton TMDC layer as well as between two TMDC layers in the double-layered system. We will consider TMDC double layers, formed by two monolayers of the same TMDC material and two different TMDC monolayers, when the transition metal atom is replaced by the other transition metal atom (e.g. for a MoS2/WS2 heterostructure) or when the chalcogenide atoms are replaced by the other chalcogenide atoms.<br><br><strong>9. Polariton superfluidity, controlled by a periodic potential.</strong> We propose to study the effects of a periodic potential on a superfluid of polaritons, formed by excitons in a TMDC monolayer, embedded in a semiconductor microcavity. Creation of periodic potential, acting on excitons in a TMDC monolayer is possible [58], Combination of optical lattice potentials with exciton periodic potentials can lead to creation of a periodic potential, acting on microcavity polaritons. We will study the linear response of the polariton superfluid to an electromagnetic wave at low and high densities of polaritons. Since the static structure factor (SSF) for small wavevectors is very sensitive to a change of density and temperature [38], we will study the SSF for various polariton densities to analyze the transition of the polariton system from the superfluid state to a non-superfluid state and its manifestation by light scattering. The procedure to obtain the SSF for polaritons is described in Sec. II. The importance of the SSF for a polariton superfluid, controlled by a peri- odic potential. SSF, measured by non-resonant scattering of electromagnetic waves, is an important quantity to study a superfluid state in an excitonic system. A pronounced maximum of the SSF occurs at small wavevectors for a dilute exciton gas and an almost flat SSF appears at higher exciton concentrations [38]. There is an opportunity to apply this high sensitivity of SSF for accurate measurements of the superfluid properties at small wavevector q. The results of our proposed calculations for SSF for polaritons can be used to observe the reduction of the superfluid concentration and the crossover to the Mott insulator phase under an increasing total polariton concentration.<br><br><strong>10. Optical absorption to probe the electron states.</strong> It is known that exciton contribute a lot into the optical absorption. In TMDC heterostructures formed by two different TMDC monolayers without a dialectic between them due to the offset between the energy levels of the valence and conduction bands of the two materials the charge transfer excitons [23] can be produced. Excitons formed in either layer due to optical excitation will spontaneously separate, with electrons (holes) hopping to the conduction (valence) band with the lower energy level of the two. This spontaneous separation of charge has led to such excitons [23]. In TMDC multilayers transformation of direct excitons to charge transfer [23] or dipolar excitons will change the optical absorption as a probe of transitions from direct into charge transfer or dipolar excitons. Two regimes of the power of laser pumping will be considered: (i) a linear regime at low laser power and (ii) a non-linear regime, where the interaction between excitons becomes strong due to higher power of laser pimping.<br>10.A. Effect of the gate voltage. The applied gate voltage changes the exciton energy and the rate of the transformation of direct excitons into dipolar excitons. We will study the optical absorption as a function of the gate voltage and the power of laser pumping and compare the results of our calculations with the experiments. In TMDC three-layers there is the number of mechanisms of transformation of direct excitons into dipolar excitons. We will do the calculations for TMDC multilayers and three-layers, taking into account all these mechanisms. Particularly we will consider to create the dipolar excitons, the electric field is required to be applied to separate electric charges. Due to the dialectic barrier between TMDC layers, electron-hole recombination for dipolar excitons is suppressed, and the life-time of dipolar excitons is larger than for charge transfer excitons. Besides, the interaction between dipolar excitons is stronger than between the charge transfer excitons due to larger dipole moment of dipolar excitons. The exciton-exciton interaction affects the optical absorption and nonlinear optical properties of TMDC multilayers. We propose the method to control the optical absorption and nonlinear optical properties of TMDC multilayers by the applied gate voltage and consider the exciton-exciton interaction using the Keldysh potential as in Refs. 21 and 33.<br>10.B. Two-body problem for an electron and a hole in TMDC three-layers and multilayers. The binding energies, energies of transitions between different states, and wave functions of dipolar and charge transfer excitons in TMDC three-layers and multilayers will be calculated by solving numerically the Schr ̈odinger equation with the Keldysh potential for the interaction between the charge carriers, which takes into account the screening ef- fects in TMDC layers [22]. To understand the influence of screening the comparison of the calculations by employing the Coulomb and Keldysh interactions will be done.<br>10.C. Optical absorption due to exciton transitions in TMDC three-layers and multilayers. Using the calculated quantities for excitons, we will obtain the oscillator strengths, absorption coefficients for intra-excitonic transitions and transformation of direct excitons into dipolar excitons, and the absorption factor. The absorption factor is a dimen- sionless quantity which is defined as the fraction of incoming photons absorbed by a TMDC three-layer or multilayer.<br></p>
